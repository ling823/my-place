<p>Klang is divided into North Klang and South Klang, which are separated by the <strong>Klang River</strong>. <em>North Klang</em> is divided into three sub-districts which are <strong>Kapar</strong> (Located at the north of North Klang),<strong> Rantau Panjang </strong>(situated at the west of North Klang) and <strong>Meru</strong> (at the east of North Klang).

<p>
Klang North used to be the main commercial centre of Klang, but since 2008, more residential and commercial areas as well as government offices are being developed in Klang South. Most major government and private health care facilities are also located at Klang South. Hence, this area tends to be busier and becomes the centre of social and recreational activities after office hours and during the weekends. This is triggered by the rapid growth of new and modern townships such as Bandar Botanic, Bandar Bukit Tinggi, Taman Sentosa Perdana, Taman Sri Andalas, Taman Bayu Perdana, Glenmarie Cove, Kota Bayuemas etc. all located within Klang South.</p>
